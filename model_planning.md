Goal: revision predictions after primary surgery

Features: TBD

Model: TBD based on the database, features, number of cases, etc. Some thoughts...

I want this project to be accessible to interested medical staff that may not have sophisticated algorithm knowledge, so I think it might be most beneficial to provide resources that can determine the model for the medical personnel. And given that I don't know yet what the data looks like, maybe accounting for multiple models will be worthwhile.

Models that preliminarily would/should be considered:  
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machines
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - Neural Network
  - Gradient Boosting

Realistically, I will probably experiment with all these algorithms in the pursuit of answering the proposed research question. Based on prior experience, research, etc., I hypothesize the best model will likely be Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, or the Random Forest. But, I think it will be beneficial to write code that will initialize each model and score them so as to give inexperienced developers valuable resources.
